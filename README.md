# Implemented a python tool that would classify an image according to its orientation, using three machine learning algorithms (K Nearest neighbor, Adaptive Boosting and Neural Networks) and compared their performances.
# Obtained an accuracy of ~70%, ~75%, ~80% respectively in the three algorithms.
